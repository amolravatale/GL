Nobody can make me sa happy (or as sad) as I am now except my one and only loooooooove (drool). After coming back from lunch, I still didn't get any sms from him and neither is he online! Then finally after several minutes I got an sms from him telling me that just as he was about to come online, the power went off (I hope it's not some kind of bad sign!). Well, I hate to admit that I kinda doubt him to I asked him if I can call him now, just to make sure if he really is at home and wants to talk to me (well, I didn't tell him exactly THAT! He kill me!). So, I called him up and we talked...and talked...and went on for almost an hour (my boss is gonna kill me when he finds out!). I told him I'm using my boss' account and he told me it's okey and that maybe my boss wouldn't mind. I guess we really are the same more than we know.lol Then I told him that this co-worker of mine showed me a catalog to buy something and I told him I don't wanna buy anything from someone I don't like esp that Cynthia! I don't know if I've told you about her before but she is beyond me....gosh! One blog is not enough to tell you much much of a ******* whatever she is! Jan asked me why I don't wanna buy anything even if I really want that something, then I told him coz I don't want her to be happy or satisfied coz I dont like her. Jan told me it's bad and I thought oh my, I've been to honest with him he might get turned-off by me. ood thing he told me (after some nudging from me) that maybe others would think I don't have a good attitude, but he likes me and see nothing wrong with it. Oh, he's such a sweety!  I dunno if he's just teasing me or whatever but he told me he sure can face my parents and get along with them. And's kinda nice to know too that his parents let him do what he wants now since he's been responsible. I dunno how much of that I should believe coz he say some things that he forgets in the future. But, I sure really hope he's telling the truth! I really really love him. Anyways, there's only one thing, I kinda lied to him about eating pork. I just thought it's a big deal to him so I guess a little white lie wouldn't hurt. I'll just quit eating those when he finally gets here and even after that. Bt, there's also this one thing about 'wasting money for calls'. It kinda hurt me to think that he thinks that the reason why he doesn't want to call me is coz he doesn't want to waste his money. I'm so glad he clarified that issue or else....well, you know me I make a big deal out of a small one.  On a different thing, I asked Anna again if she's going anywhere after work coz I wanna go with her to church, but I guess this is not my lucky day again.=( She told me she's going home with her mom. So, there goes. Why don't I learn anything from this?! Next time I won't even invite her...she can invite herself!          \n",

So I saw 28 Days Later 2 times in the past 24 hours. The 2 newbies as I like to call them both had trouble understanding it. You're lucky I don't disown you because 28 Days Later is like a test to see if you can be friends with me. Or at least I should make it be one. But who'd want to be friends with me anyways right?  Yea I entertained a guest on Wednesday or was it Tuesday. Went to a soccer game hollerd at some people and got free pizza. Then I think my house bored him to death. So yea prolly never see that kid over here again. We got some movies, was about to rent 28 Days Later and then thought hey why dont I just buy it. So I did and now I own a movie. Just seemed to not entertain the kid tho, musta been a comedy person. We did get Eurotrip which was mildly entertaining. Previews ruined a lot of the stuff.  I also seen Day After Tomorrow wit Chelski and Derk. Twas a good movie. It was weird cuz the last movie I saw (Elf) which was 3 or 4 months previous, I saw the preview for Day After Tomorrow and said I want to see that. And turns out it was the next movie I saw. (I thought it was amusing). There was this one part that was funny though in the movie but absolutely no one thought it was, I guess maybe it wasnt a joke or something but I was laughin hard and no one else gave it a thought but Chelsea laughed after I was laughing for awhile.  Yea, err so people annoy me a lot. A lot of people annoy me a lot. But yea, theres this one Rugrats episode where Phil and Lil were like you know the more time you spend with each other youll end up hating each other? Well I think that is kinda true. It happens all the fucking fuck time. So yes.  I hate the way things turn out. Period. Just period.  Me and Derk, got into this fight with Chelseas X Kevin.

No monthly plans really fit my needs.  I really don't use the home phone that much since I have had a cell phone for a while now that includes long distance and unlimited nights and weeekend minutes.  But I still felt the need to have one, especially since I can remember during certain times my home phone was all I had while going through 9/11 in NYC.  But really I occasionally use it if my cell phone battery was dead and also if I needed to send a fax from by computer.  Just recently I discovered  urlLink Vonage .  Basically they provide me with a AD converter to turn any of my cheap analog phones into an IP phone.  The negetive is that my phone will go out during any Internet or power outages.  The positive is that I get unlimited long distance calls anywhere in the US and Canada.  I also get free CallID, voicemail, Call forwarding, ........etc.  I can even recieve a email whenever I get a new voicemail and can even listen to the message over the Internet while I am at work or whatever, from any computer online.  It's cool because it is also transportable.  I can take my AD converter to any broadband connection and can make and recieve calls at any time with any plain, cheap analog phone.  It's bananas.  And this is all for only about $25/month.  I'm looking forward to the installation.  I should be recieving the shipment in the next few days.  I'll be sure to keep the site posted.

Tomorrow after work, I have a staff meeting, then K has soccer practice at 6 and R has a game across town at 7.  Thursday E has a game.

Let me show everybody what she's up to now...  Posted by: oneandonly 115 mins What? no comments? lol Here's a scenario to think about (sorry, scenario might be too big of a word for ya--let's say, 'pretend') First one-let's say that AA in Business actually means something and you actually get to interview with some reputable company.... Most reputable companies do a complete background check on possible employees. (of course, we all know your work history, or lack there-of, is null and void). And oopsies! Judy Hallquist has several things that are cause for alarm in her past. Recent past that is. A restraining order in regards to internet stalking? harassing phone calls? internet email hacking? not to mention a complaint about using schools puter for harassments? See, if I was the future employer, I'd say, 'thank you for applying, but no thanks.' You need to think about the future and the actions you are partaking in now...at least I would. We realize you are probably in the manic phase of your disease and probably not in control of too much at this time.....take those meds. *side note-I always wondered how you managed to get a school bus driving job with a child abuse charge against you?* but keep posting~    End...  I posted a reply, basically showing her she's just S.T.U.P.I.D. and she goes and deletes it... Then she brings up lies and trash. She's really got to get a life.  I do have an A.A.S. in Business, that's about all she's got right on her post. Meds, she's the one that's been to the doctor lately. Child abuse charge, she needs to go back to her source, and verify because I will press slander and liable charges.  Trying to scare me with my future employment, ha ha ha, I've got a GREAT job and you are scared that when I get sick of this shit beyond belief, I will file for mod of support. I will do that too. You do need to be fearful of that, because as you know, as both parties incomes go UP, the support goes UP. So, you better hope Mike pays the medical bills soon because I will be pursueing this  very soon if i'm not happy with this arrangement. And yes, I know YOU, SHELLY, are the reason Mike's not paid to date. But, that's okay, i've spoke with someone... taken care of the formalities... Remember my post on FA? Regarding the lump sum of money i'm getting soon? I will be able to file all the papers I need... Then Mike will be traveling to Oregon... Kewl, HUH??? Prolly without YOU. Did you even give Mike his mail, with the copies of the bills and receipts???  Oh yea, Ya know that saying, 'This is an attempt to collect a debt.' Anything will be used to collect on this debt.

      "Title:\t       I'm also unemployed, gaining weight and live with my parents, but that's not the topic for today.  If, like me, you are interested in keeping up with all the online ramblings of your friends, family and political analysts then you just have to know when someone posts an update!  Clicking through your favorites, looking at AIM profiles, or manually keying in foshee.blogspot.com is just no longer acceptable.  (Doing that 15 times a day is just not efficient.)  So, thankfully hundreds of software developers (God bless them all) have been hard at work writing blog/news reading software.  These programs automatically check to see when posts have been made.  They also give you a one-stop interface to see what those of us with fantastically interesting lives have been up to.  I downloaded 4 of these programs and will give you my candid evaluation here.  If you are not like me and could care less about software to read blogs, then stop reading right now.  It only gets worse.   4th Place:  urlLink Pluck   Selected as a  urlLink a C|Net Editor's choice , it gets last place with me simply because of the fact that it aggravated me the most.  Pluck is not a stand-alone application.  Instead it is used as an Explorer Bar in Internet Explorer (like History or Favorites).  This means that to install it, all your IE windows have to be closed (strike one).  It also adds buttons to your IE toolbars, and I hate it when new software changes interfaces I have taken the time to customize.  It shows a complete disregard for the whole concept.  Pluck also claims to be ``Adware Spyware Free,'' yet it is constantly advertising Ebay, Amazon and Google among other things.  We all know  urlLink I love Google , so the last thing I need to see is an ad for it.  (strike two)  Finally, its major fault is feature-bloat.  It is just overloaded with features I am not looking for in a news reader.  This makes the interface ridiculously complicated.  (It took me far too long to figure out how to add my own feed.)  You even have to sign up for a an account to use some of the features.  As if anyone wants to sign up for yet another online account for anything...  (strike three)   3rd Place:  urlLink SharpReader   This package actually suffers from the opposite problem as Pluck.  Instead of being overwhelmed, the user (me) was left guessing by the sparsity of the interface.  While context (right-click) menus had plenty of options, none of them were: Add a new feed.  That is an absent-minded omission and hopefully will be corrected in future versions.    Otherwise the application is clean, simple, and possesses the expected features.   2nd Place:  urlLink BlogExpress    I was happily using this software for a few days, pleased with its attractive toolbars and easy-to-learn interface.  It also provides multitab browsing (with the option of opening new IE windows).  Unfortunately it has a couple annoying bugs.  First, it sometimes ignores formatting like paragraph breaks in Blogger posts.  Second, it does not correctly interpret the links to individual Blogger posts.  Instead, when you try to open a post, it brings you to a page with  urlLink an error .  Perhaps Blogger is not following the XML standard, or perhaps BlogExpress really has a bug.  Either way, its a major handicap in using it.   1st Place:  urlLink Feedreader   As they say on the homepage, it is simple and lightweight.  It provides the features I want, without the annoying extras.  And it handles Blogger feeds appropriately.  The toolbar has just a few simple options which are easy to understand, and you can customize which buttons show up.  My major complaint would be that you cannot change the size of the buttons or remove the labels.  They are too large for my taste, and the labels become superfluous after some experience.    For you real computer nerds, it is also open source (under  urlLink GPL ), so if you really don't like something about it you can change it yourself!   Well, I know this has been one of my more technical posts, so I apologize for those of you who found it boring...  But should you embrace your addiction to my blog anytime soon, you should consult this post to see how best to keep up with me.  If you are wondering what the address is for my site feed, it is:  urlLink http://foshee.blogspot.com/atom.xml   This follows the same standard as other Blogger and Blogspot blogs.  Just take the normal address and add atom.xml to the end.  By the way, does anyone know how to subscribe to  urlLink LiveJournal  feeds?  Thanks for reading, dear Blogfan!     \n",

The FBI came to his workplace and interrogated him about his activities and acquaintances, and requested information about the offending article.

      "Title:\t                 The past week and a half have been very busy!!  First I had church camp for a whole week!  I had fun but it made me think alot!  It was definitly great to see my friends and to meet new ones!  Im so happy I finally got to see them!  This year at camp really made me see how strong my friendship was with some of my greater friends!  I mean dont get me wrong I love them no matter what but I did get tested quite a bit that week!  I learned alot about God too!  I didnt even begin to think of how we are all in a battle right now!  Not just our troops in Iraq or any others for that fact!  We are in a battle against satan and God is our leader ,our colonel if you will!  I never would have thought to put it in that context!  I think it was the hardest to leave this year because I totally realized alot this past week!  It was very hard leaving Madison and Taylor and Meagan!  It was especially hard to leave Leah!  By the way I wrote a new poem mainly for Leah and Madison but its to all my friends too!  Its not good at all to me but Ive heard it was pretty good!  I dont know!  I think I cried the most this year and I hate crying!  I just hate it when you are in the reality of the world and just when I feel like Im gonna blow!  I go to church camp and it all just comes together and Im finally able to be in a christian atmosphere!  I can relate to all these people with at least one thing and thats the love I have for God!  I get close to God and just when it seems I could stay in this wonderful place forever its time to leave and go back to that horrible place we call the real world!  Some can be good but most things that are going on around me arent what God wants and I hate that!  Well to sum this camp week up, I had fun, learned alot, got tested alot, and made greater realationships with my old and new friends!  Right after I left camp I went straight to Temple to play some SOFTBALL!  Well sorda I sat that game!  It stunk but its ok I played the whole game the last 2!  That day was extremely hard because the night before I went to bed at 3 and got up at 7 in the morning!  Well I had a softball game at 11:30 that night and lets just say it went into extra extra innings!  HA!  Well I ended up going to bed at 2:45 the next morning!  Then we had to get up at 9 that morning to play another game at 11!  Then we played another at 5!  It was alot of fun but I cried some more when I lost the game for my team!  Let me just say that there was a girl on third and we had 2 outs!  It was 2-2 and pitcher throws a fastball a little outside but I swing and it barely hits the bat but its fair!  I run as fast as I can to first and Im about 4-5 feet away when I see the ball out of the corner of my eye going right into the 1st basemans glove!!  IM OUT!!!!  It ends 4-5 in the 10th inning!  UGH I WANTED TO BE THE HERO!!!  Its not as much of the fact that I didnt hit the ball good or that I got out!  Its the fact that I let my whole team down!  Anyways we were out of the tournament!  That night I went out with Janaye, Jenna, Daniel, Danny, Mrs. Julianne, my niece, my mom, step dad, Moni, Molly, Meagan, and John to eat at El Chico!  We ate and talked and had a good time and then we went to get ice cream!  Then we came back to the hotel and got on the computer!  (well other people did I didnt get the chance) Then we had to leave and I went to bed and the next day we came home!  The past 2 days have been boring except I had softball practice yesterday!  I also got in a fight with this girl named Amberly because she came up to the softball field to hit with this girl Katie and her dad and no body on my team likes her! She is nice to me but Im not mean to her!  Well we got in a fight because they were talking about her at practice and she wanted to know what they said and I wouldnt tell her b/c Im not like that!  Well I better go b/c this is really long and I could probably go on forever!  GOD BLESS YALL!!         \n",

I love a wonderful man. Oh, yes, and I have MS. That's multiple sclerosis, for those of you that don't know. It's a chronic and debilitating disease that spends most of it's time frustrating the hell out of me.  It's July 2004 and I've just had my first relapse in two years. For those of you who don't know anyone with MS and even if you do, you might read through the days here and see what it's like from the inside. Odds are, unless you live with the person, you don't really know what's going on. 'How are you?' is always answered with 'Fine.' or 'It's a slow day.' Which tells you nothing.  I'm nothing special, no different from anyone else. But unlike many others I want people around me to know I'm disabled and why. The better educated people are, the more normal they'll treat me and the better they may know what to do if something happens to me.  span >The fast lane is all relative. I have days that I feel great and am really moving down the hallway with my walker and a coworker will fly by walking backwards to apologize about the hurry they're in and how that this is their normal pace. My response, and it's most often the truth, is that my current pace is running - for me. We laugh and off they go. No matter how good I feel, how good a mood I'm in, how happy I am that I'm on my feet this day, how well I know I'm doing - there is ALWAYS the memory that I used to walk that way too. It isn't a sadness really, just a memory that I used to be normal.  My MS didn't hit until 1992 and then wasn't recognized. Medicine has come a long way. I was finally diagnosed in 1999 and then only by accident. Doctors do NOT want to label you. With MS you're never in remission and you'll never be cured. Can't blame the docs really, but if they'd made some decisions sooner, treatment could have started sooner. All water under the bridge now. Ok, I could blather on here for quite some time, but I'll leave you with this for now. I'll be back, hope you will too.span>               \n",

      "Title:\t             Today I finally had some Scotch Whisky. I visited The Scotch Whisky Heritage Centre. A couple of days ago I was approached in the street by someone who wanted to do a survey of tourists coming to Edinburgh. If I showed up at a hotel the following day and promised to participate in a focus group I was going to be given £40. Pretty good pay for an hour so I went. There were 8 of us, 3 Americans, 2 Canadians, 1 Lett, 1 Chinese, and me. We received the money immediately and then they served us coffee and tea. The focus group discussion was taped and basically the Scotch Whisky Heritage Centre wanted to know why we had not visited their attraction since it was right near the Castle. We all gave our reasons why and left forty pounds richer. We had a nice time actually, and were given brochures of the whisky centre which made us all decide to go there now that we knew about it.  Yesterday the weather was absolutely horrible. Windy and rainy and cold. At least today the rain didn't fall sideways... I went to Holyrood Palace yesterday, only to find out it was closed 23 June to 5 July. Next I went to an interactive exhibition called Dynamic Earth--only to find out they had closed at 15:15. Typical. I went to the hotel to wait for my 40 pounds instead. After the market research Margita and I had a really nice girls' dinner, just the 2 of us. We caught up and reminisced about old times ('yes, remember that one who, at 17, said he had always liked older women, and I was only 21!).  Today I finally got to both Dynamic Earth and the Whisky Centre. I really enjoyed getting to know how whisky is made and the distinctions between malt whisky and blended whisky. Whisky is the Gaelic word for 'water of life' in case you didn't know.  In the evening went with Margita to the children's weekly swimming lesson. Great fun. Freja is crazy in the water. She extra crazy today because of her birthday. She told every person she met: 'I'm five today.' Cute. I gave her a t-shirt (pink of course!) where it says: 'I'm a wee angel'.  Early tomorrow morning I take off for Copenhagen. From there I will hop on the train and cross over to Sweden to visit Susanne (aka Sushi), an old school friend who lives in Halmstad. Hopefully we will be able to celebrate midsummer in style, but the weather doesn't look that promising. Oh well, it's the being together that counts.

      "Title:\t             'He who lives in solitude may make his own laws.'  ~ Publilius Syrus    Superficial loss; I think that superficial loss is the single most difficult thing for the human mind to comprehend.  When we loose our keys, chances are we are going to find them, this is not the sense of loss I am talking about.  Im talking about that sense of loss that could have been prevented, that sense of loss that could have been stopped or detoured.  Senseless, superficial loss, nothing so dramatic as death and yet I have been thinking that this is a day to day thing in the world.    For example, when we loose a friend a topic I have come to be an expert on- that friend can never be replaced.  Sure we will always get other friends hopefully- but that friend who left our lives cannot ever be replaced.  Now again I am not talking about death or anything so dramatic, I only mean the sort of superficial, needless loss that exists when a friendship breaks-up or grows apart.  When a friend moves away, chances are you and she/he are going to grow apart.    Now I suppose it isnt always so glum.  I have a friend, a girl I have known since the 7th grade and who moved away in the 10th grade.  We are still friends, now nearly 10 years since she moved.  We correspond, weather by the miracle of email or by what has come to be known as snail-mail.  We send on another pictures and such every so often.  So I suppose that its not all doom and gloom, but still she and I are no as close as we were in school, before she moved.    The Internet and snail-mail are fine and well but there lacks a sense of personal contact, again I shake my head and say; Superficial loss.    Now, there exists a world where it is no longer necessary for a person to leave their homes for friendship and companionship.  It is no longer necessary to go out and make friends, hell its hardly necessary to have any friends in flesh, so to speak.  Now we live in a world where anyone can have a friend for the $30.00 I have a cable modem- a month everyone pays for the Internet.  To me this is a whole new sense of superficial loss.  It is the superficial loss of personal companionship.  How sad.  I suppose that I all of this talk has been brought about by the fact that a friend of mine my best friend for the past 3  years just moved away.  I suppose it was bound to happen some time, either that or I would have had to move, but I still feel the sense of loss for the whole situation.  I suppose its because I dont make friends very easily and I like to hold onto the ones I have, or perhaps its because she and I were close friends, we both moved to town about the same time and neither of us knew a single soul save my husband.  It all just strikes me as very, very sad.  Yet it is a situation that could not be helped right now.  So hopefully she will move back, or I will go see her.  I am going to have to refuse to let this situation result in superficial loss.  ~Kristyn           \n",
